# aws-s3-uploader

awscli is bulky. created this small cli to upload images to aws s3. this can be used as binary unlike awscli which is built upon python

Alternatively, you can use cURL with [aws s3 REST APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html), I just wanted to hack this in golang. TBH, I realised this as on option too late :)
